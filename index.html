<h1>Academy for Internet Research</h1>

<h3><u>Who are we?</u></h3>

<p>
We are a group of security researchers that wish to make internet free, safe and
accessible to all. </p>

<h3><u>What do we do?</u></h3>

<p>
We specialize in making internet safer by proactively scanning and
checking for active vulnerabilities, open ports and CPE strings in the wild against all known
ipv4 addresses. If we see an open port we will <b>never do anything
    malicious</b> and if we suspect you are vulnerable to something nasty send you an email
assocaited with your domain. Think of us as future Shodan or Censys working for the benefit of
all!
